Parallel lines are two lines in the same plane that never intersect, no matter how far they are extended. They are always straight lines with an equal distance between each other. Parallel lines can be both horizontal and vertical.

Here are some of the properties of parallel lines:

* They are always the same distance apart.
* They never intersect, no matter how far they are extended.
* They have the same slope.
* If a transversal line intersects two parallel lines, then the corresponding angles are congruent, the alternate interior angles are congruent, and the alternate exterior angles are congruent.

Here are some examples of parallel lines in real life:

* The opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel.
* The railway tracks run parallel to each other.
* The edges of a ruler are parallel to each other.
* The lines on a piece of ruled paper are parallel.
* The white lines on a zebra crossing are parallel.

Parallel lines are an important concept in geometry and have many applications in the real world. For example, parallel lines are used in the construction of buildings, bridges, and other structures. They are also used in the design of roads, railways, and other transportation systems.
