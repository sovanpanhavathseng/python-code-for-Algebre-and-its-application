// This code first defines a function called are_parallel() that takes two lines as input and returns True if the lines are parallel, and False otherwise. The function works by first checking if the two lines have the same slope. If they do, then the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.

// The main function of the code then defines two lines, line1 and line2, and passes them to the are_parallel() function. The are_parallel() function then returns True, indicating that the two lines are parallel.

// To run the code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as parallel_lines.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
