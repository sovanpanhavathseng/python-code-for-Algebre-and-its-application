Elementary row operations are three types of operations that can be performed on matrices that do not change the solution set of the system of linear equations represented by the matrix. These operations are:

* **Row interchange:** Swapping two rows of a matrix.
* **Scalar multiplication:** Multiplying a row of a matrix by a non-zero constant.
* **Row addition:** Adding a multiple of one row of a matrix to another row of the matrix.

Elementary row operations are used in many different areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, numerical analysis, and differential equations. They are particularly useful for solving systems of linear equations and finding the inverse of a matrix.

**Applications of elementary row operations**

Here are some specific applications of elementary row operations:

* **Solving systems of linear equations:** Elementary row operations can be used to solve systems of linear equations by converting the augmented matrix of the system to row-echelon form. Row-echelon form is a special type of matrix where each row has a leading 1, all leading 1's are to the right of all the leading 1's in the rows above, and all entries below a leading 1 are 0. Once the augmented matrix is in row-echelon form, the solution to the system of linear equations can be easily read off from the matrix.
* **Finding the inverse of a matrix:** Elementary row operations can also be used to find the inverse of a matrix. To do this, we append the identity matrix to the original matrix and then use elementary row operations to reduce the augmented matrix to the form [I|A⁻¹]. Once the augmented matrix is in this form, the inverse of the original matrix is the matrix A⁻¹ on the right-hand side of the augmented matrix.
* **Calculating the determinant of a matrix:** Elementary row operations can also be used to calculate the determinant of a matrix. The determinant of a matrix is a number that is associated with a square matrix and can be used to determine whether the matrix is invertible. To calculate the determinant of a matrix using elementary row operations, we first reduce the matrix to row-echelon form. The determinant of the matrix is then equal to the product of the leading entries of the row-echelon form of the matrix.
* **Finding the null space of a matrix:** The null space of a matrix is the set of all vectors that are solutions to the homogeneous system of linear equations represented by the matrix. Elementary row operations can be used to find the null space of a matrix by reducing the matrix to row-echelon form and then solving the system of linear equations represented by the row-echelon form.

**Example**

Consider the following system of linear equations:

```
2x + y = 3
3x + 2y = 5
```

We can represent this system of linear equations by the following augmented matrix:

```
[2 1 | 3]
[3 2 | 5]
```

We can use elementary row operations to solve this system of linear equations by first converting the augmented matrix to row-echelon form:

```
[2 1 | 3]
[0 1 | -1]
```

Now, we can easily read off the solution to the system of linear equations from the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix:

```
x = 1
y = -1
```

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is (x, y) = (1, -1).

Elementary row operations are a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in mathematics. They are an essential part of linear algebra and are used in many other areas of mathematics as well.
