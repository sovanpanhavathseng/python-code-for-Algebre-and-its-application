A percentage is a number or ratio that can be expressed as a fraction of 100. It is a way of expressing a part of a whole as a number out of 100. The word "percent" comes from the Latin words "per" and "cent", which mean "out of" and "hundred" respectively.

Percentages can be written in a number of ways, including:

* As a number with a percent sign (%) after it, such as 50%.
* As a fraction, such as 50/100 = 0.5.
* As a decimal, such as 50.0% = 0.50.

To calculate a percentage, you can use the following formula:

```
percentage = (part / whole) * 100
```

For example, to calculate 50% of 100, you would use the following formula:

```
percentage = (50 / 100) * 100
```

This would give you an answer of 50, which is 50 out of 100.

Percentages are used in a wide variety of contexts, including:

* Business: to track sales, profits, and expenses.
* Finance: to calculate interest rates, dividends, and investment returns.
* Statistics: to analyze data and make predictions.
* Everyday life: to compare prices, measure progress, and make decisions.

Understanding percentages can be helpful in a variety of situations. By learning how to calculate and interpret percentages, you can make better decisions about your finances, your health, and your overall well-being.
