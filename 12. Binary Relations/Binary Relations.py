// This code defines a function called binary_relation() that takes two sets as input, the domain and the codomain of the relation, and returns a set of ordered pairs representing the relation. The main function then uses this function to create a binary relation on the set of integers where x is related to y if x is less than y. The relation is then printed to the console.
