// This code first defines a function called linear_equation() that takes two arguments, the slope m and the y-intercept b, and returns the equation of a linear line in slope-intercept form. The function then uses the format() method to format the equation and return it.

// The main function then sets the slope and y-intercept of the line, and then calls the linear_equation() function to get the equation of the line. The equation is then printed to the console.

// To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as linear_equation.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
