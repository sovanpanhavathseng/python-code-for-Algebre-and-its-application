**Rational Functions with Oblique or Curvilinear Asymptotes**

A rational function is any function that can be written as the ratio of two polynomials. For example, the function $f(x)=\frac{x}{x-1}$ is a rational function.

An oblique or curvilinear asymptote of a rational function is a line or curve that the graph of the function approaches as the $x$-value approaches positive or negative infinity. Oblique and curvilinear asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator of the rational function.

To find the oblique or curvilinear asymptotes of a rational function, we can use polynomial long division to divide the numerator by the denominator. The quotient of this division is the equation of the oblique or curvilinear asymptote.

**Applications of Rational Functions with Oblique or Curvilinear Asymptotes**

Rational functions with oblique or curvilinear asymptotes are used in a variety of applications, including:

* **Engineering:** Rational functions with oblique or curvilinear asymptotes can be used to model the behavior of structures under load. For example, the deflection of a beam under load can be modeled by a rational function with an oblique asymptote.
* **Physics:** Rational functions with oblique or curvilinear asymptotes can be used to model the behavior of physical systems over time. For example, the trajectory of a projectile can be modeled by a rational function with a curvilinear asymptote.
* **Economics:** Rational functions with oblique or curvilinear asymptotes can be used to model the behavior of economic systems over time. For example, the demand for a product over time can be modeled by a rational function with an oblique asymptote.

Here are some specific examples of how rational functions with oblique or curvilinear asymptotes are used in real-world applications:

* **Engineers use rational functions with oblique asymptotes to model the deflection of bridges under load.** This information can be used to design bridges that are strong enough to withstand the expected loads.
* **Physicists use rational functions with curvilinear asymptotes to model the trajectory of projectiles.** This information can be used to design weapons and other devices that need to launch objects with accuracy.
* **Economists use rational functions with oblique asymptotes to model the demand for products over time.** This information can be used to forecast demand and make decisions about production and inventory.

**Conclusion**

Rational functions with oblique or curvilinear asymptotes are a powerful tool for modeling the behavior of systems in a variety of fields. By understanding these concepts, we can better understand and predict the behavior of the world around us.
