**Rational Functions and Vertical Asymptotes**

A rational function is a function that can be expressed as the quotient of two polynomials. For example, the function $f(x)=\frac{x}{x-1}$ is a rational function.

A vertical asymptote of a rational function is a vertical line that the graph of the function approaches as the $x$-value approaches a certain value. Vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator of the rational function approaches zero.

To find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function, we can factor the denominator and look for the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero. For example, the denominator of the function $f(x)=\frac{x}{x-1}$ is $x-1$. Therefore, the function has a vertical asymptote at $x=1$.

**Applications of Rational Functions and Vertical Asymptotes**

Rational functions are used in many different areas of mathematics and science. For example, rational functions can be used to model the following:

* The speed of a falling object
* The concentration of a chemical in a solution
* The population of a species over time
* The cost of producing a certain number of items

Vertical asymptotes can be used to understand the behavior of these models as the $x$-value approaches a certain value. For example, the vertical asymptote of the function that models the speed of a falling object at $x=0$ tells us that the speed of the object becomes infinite as it approaches the ground.

Here are some specific examples of how rational functions and vertical asymptotes are used in real-world applications:

* **Engineering:** Rational functions can be used to design bridges, buildings, and other structures. For example, engineers use rational functions to model the forces that act on a bridge and to design the bridge to withstand those forces.
* **Medicine:** Rational functions can be used to model the concentration of drugs in the bloodstream and to determine the optimal dosage for a patient.
* **Economics:** Rational functions can be used to model the relationship between supply and demand and to predict the price of goods and services.

**Conclusion**

Rational functions and vertical asymptotes are important concepts in mathematics with many real-world applications. By understanding these concepts, we can better understand and model the world around us.
