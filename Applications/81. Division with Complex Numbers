**Division with Complex Numbers**

To divide two complex numbers, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. The complex conjugate of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is $z^* = a - bi$.

This technique is similar to rationalizing the denominator of a fraction with a quadratic denominator. By multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we can eliminate the imaginary part of the denominator and get a real number in the denominator.

**Steps to Divide Complex Numbers**

1. Write the division problem as a fraction.
2. Determine the complex conjugate of the denominator.
3. Multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the complex conjugate of the denominator.
4. Expand the brackets and simplify using $i^2 = -1$.
5. Express the answer in the form $a + bi$, reducing any fractions.

**Example:**

Divide the complex numbers $z_1 = 3 + 2i$ and $z_2 = 2 + i$.

Solution:

```
z_1 / z_2 = (3 + 2i) / (2 + i)
```

Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we get:

```
(3 + 2i) / (2 + i) * (2 - i) / (2 - i) = (3 + 2i) * (2 - i) / (2^2 - 1 * i^2)
```

Expanding the brackets and simplifying, we get:

```
(3 + 2i) * (2 - i) / (2^2 - 1 * i^2) = (6 - 5i + 4i - 2i^2) / (4 + 1)
```

Substituting $i^2 = -1$, we get:

```
(6 - 5i + 4i + 2) / (4 + 1) = 8 - i / 5
```

Therefore, the answer is $8 - i / 5$.

**Applications of Division with Complex Numbers**

Division with complex numbers is used in many different fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Here are a few examples:

* **Electrical engineering:** Complex numbers are used to represent electrical quantities such as voltage, current, and impedance. Division with complex numbers is used to calculate the voltage and current in electrical circuits.
* **Physics:** Complex numbers are used to represent waves and other physical phenomena. Division with complex numbers is used to calculate the reflection and transmission of waves at interfaces.
* **Computer science:** Complex numbers are used in many areas of computer science, including signal processing, image processing, and cryptography. Division with complex numbers is used to implement various algorithms in these areas.

In addition to these specific applications, division with complex numbers is also used in many other areas where complex numbers are used. For example, it is used to solve mathematical equations, to analyze data, and to design and implement various systems and devices.
