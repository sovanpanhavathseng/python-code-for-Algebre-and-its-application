A union of intervals is a set of intervals that are disjoint, meaning that they do not share any common elements. The union of two intervals can be found by simply taking the union of the elements of each interval. For example, the union of the intervals (1, 3) and (4, 6) is the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Interval unions are used in a variety of applications, including:

* **Rigorous numerical analysis:** Interval unions can be used to represent the solution set of a system of linear equations with uncertainties. This is useful for applications where the exact values of the coefficients of the equations are not known, but only upper and lower bounds are available.
* **Computer-aided geometric design (CAD):** Interval unions can be used to represent the boundaries of geometric objects, such as curves and surfaces. This is useful for applications where the exact shape of an object is not known, but only upper and lower bounds on its dimensions are available.
* **Mathematical optimization:** Interval unions can be used to represent the feasible region of an optimization problem. This is useful for applications where the objective function and constraints of the problem are not known exactly, but only upper and lower bounds are available.

Here are some additional details about the applications of unions of intervals:

* In rigorous numerical analysis, interval unions can be used to represent the solution set of a system of linear equations with uncertainties. This is done by first creating an interval for each unknown in the system. The union of all of these intervals is then the interval that represents the possible solutions to the system. This approach can be used to find rigorous bounds on the solutions to the system, even if the exact values of the coefficients are not known.
* In computer-aided geometric design (CAD), interval unions can be used to represent the boundaries of geometric objects, such as curves and surfaces. This is done by creating an interval for each point on the boundary of the object. The union of all of these intervals is then the interval that represents the possible points on the boundary. This approach can be used to represent objects with complex shapes, even if the exact shape of the object is not known.
* In mathematical optimization, interval unions can be used to represent the feasible region of an optimization problem. This is done by creating an interval for each variable in the problem. The union of all of these intervals is then the interval that represents the possible values of the variables that satisfy the constraints of the problem. This approach can be used to find rigorous bounds on the optimal solution to the problem, even if the objective function and constraints are not known exactly.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
