To add or subtract complex numbers, we simply add or subtract the real and imaginary parts separately. For example, to add the complex numbers $z = 3 + 4i$ and $w = -5 + 7i$, we do the following:

```
z + w = (3 - 5) + (4 + 7)i = -2 + 11i
```

To subtract the complex numbers $z = 3 + 4i$ and $w = -5 + 7i$, we do the following:

```
z - w = (3 + 5) + (4 - 7)i = 8 - 3i
```

Complex numbers have many applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Here are a few examples:

* **Electrical engineering:** Complex numbers are used to analyze and design electrical circuits. For example, the impedance of an AC circuit is a complex number.
* **Quantum mechanics:** Complex numbers are used to describe the behavior of quantum particles. For example, the wave function of a quantum particle is a complex function.
* **Signal processing:** Complex numbers are used to analyze and process signals, such as audio and video signals. For example, the Fourier transform of a signal is a complex function.

Here is a specific example of how complex numbers can be used in electrical engineering:

Suppose we have an AC circuit with a resistor $R$, an inductor $L$, and a capacitor $C$. The impedance of the circuit is given by the following complex number:

```
Z = R + i(ωL - 1/(ωC))
```

where ω is the angular frequency of the AC current.

The impedance of the circuit determines how much current will flow through the circuit for a given voltage. We can use complex number analysis to design the circuit so that the impedance has the desired value at the desired frequency.

For example, we might want to design a circuit that has a high impedance at a certain frequency. This would block the current from flowing through the circuit at that frequency. This is useful for designing filters that can block unwanted frequencies from passing through a circuit.

Complex numbers are a powerful tool that has many applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering.
