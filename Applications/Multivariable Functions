A multivariable function is a function that takes more than one number as an input and gives one number as an output. For example, the function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 takes two numbers, x and y, as input and gives one number, the sum of x^2 and y^2, as output.

Multivariable functions are used in many different applications, such as:

* **Physics:** to model the motion of objects in space. For example, the position of a projectile in flight can be modeled by a multivariable function of the time and the initial velocity and angle of launch.
* **Engineering:** to design and analyze structures and machines. For example, the stress on a beam can be calculated using a multivariable function of the beam's dimensions and the forces acting on it.
* **Economics:** to model the behavior of markets and economies. For example, the supply and demand for a product can be modeled by a multivariable function of the price of the product and other factors such as the cost of production.
* **Chemistry:** to model the behavior of molecules and chemical reactions. For example, the energy of a molecule can be calculated using a multivariable function of the positions and velocities of the atoms in the molecule.
* **Machine learning:** to train models to recognize patterns in data. For example, a machine learning model could be trained to recognize faces by using a multivariable function that takes the pixel values of an image as input and outputs a probability that the image contains a face.

The Python code you provided defines two multivariable functions:

* `f(x, y)`, which returns the sum of x^2 and y^2.
* `g(x, y)`, which returns the product of x and y.

The output of the code shows that `f(2, 3)` is 13 and `g(2, 3)` is 6.

I hope this helps!
