Gauss-Jordan elimination is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations and finding the inverse of a matrix. It is a variant of Gaussian elimination, which stops after reducing the matrix to echelon form. Gauss-Jordan elimination continues until the matrix is in reduced row echelon form.

To solve a system of linear equations using Gauss-Jordan elimination, we first write the system as an augmented matrix. Then, we use the following elementary row operations to reduce the matrix to reduced row echelon form:

* **Interchange any two rows.**
* **Multiply any row by a nonzero constant.**
* **Add a multiple of one row to another row.**

A matrix is in reduced row echelon form if and only if the following conditions hold:

* All rows consisting only of zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.
* The leading entry of each nonzero row is 1.
* The leading entry of each nonzero row is to the right of the leading entry of the row above it.
* All other entries in the column containing a leading 1 are 0.

Once the matrix is in reduced row echelon form, the solution to the system of linear equations can be read directly from the matrix. Each row of the matrix represents one equation, and the leading entry of each nonzero row corresponds to the variable that is being solved for.

Gauss-Jordan elimination can also be used to find the inverse of a matrix. To do this, we augment the matrix with the identity matrix and then reduce the augmented matrix to reduced row echelon form. If the original matrix is invertible, then the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix will be the identity matrix with the inverse of the original matrix on the right side.

Gauss-Jordan elimination has a wide range of applications in mathematics, science, and engineering. It is used to solve systems of linear equations in many different areas, including physics, chemistry, economics, and computer science. It is also used to find the inverse of matrices, which is important for many different tasks, such as computing determinants and solving differential equations.

Here are some specific examples of applications of Gauss-Jordan elimination:

* **Solving systems of linear equations in physics.** Gauss-Jordan elimination can be used to solve systems of linear equations that arise in many different areas of physics, such as circuit analysis, mechanics, and thermodynamics. For example, it can be used to find the currents and voltages in an electrical circuit, or to calculate the forces acting on a system of objects.
* **Solving systems of linear equations in chemistry.** Gauss-Jordan elimination can also be used to solve systems of linear equations that arise in chemistry, such as chemical equilibrium and kinetics. For example, it can be used to calculate the concentrations of different substances in a chemical reaction, or to determine the rate of a chemical reaction.
* **Solving systems of linear equations in economics.** Gauss-Jordan elimination can also be used to solve systems of linear equations that arise in economics, such as input-output analysis and general equilibrium theory. For example, it can be used to calculate the output of different industries in an economy, or to determine the equilibrium prices of different goods and services.
* **Finding the inverse of matrices.** Gauss-Jordan elimination can be used to find the inverse of matrices, which is important for many different tasks, such as computing determinants and solving differential equations. For example, the inverse of a matrix can be used to solve a system of linear equations, or to find the least-squares solution to a problem.

Gauss-Jordan elimination is a powerful and versatile algorithm that has many applications in mathematics, science, and engineering. It is a relatively simple algorithm to understand and implement, and it is very efficient for solving systems of linear equations and finding the inverse of matrices.
