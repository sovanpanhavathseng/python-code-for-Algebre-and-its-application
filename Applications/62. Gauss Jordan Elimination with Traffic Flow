Gauss-Jordan elimination is a powerful mathematical technique that can be used to solve systems of linear equations. It is a systematic process of using row operations to reduce a matrix to its reduced row echelon form. Once the matrix is in reduced row echelon form, the solution to the system of linear equations can be easily read off.

Gauss-Jordan elimination has a number of applications in traffic flow modeling. For example, it can be used to:

* **Determine the traffic flow rates between different intersections in a network.**
* **Identify bottlenecks in the traffic network and develop strategies to improve traffic flow.**
* **Optimize the timing of traffic signals.**
* **Evaluate the impact of proposed transportation projects on traffic flow.**

To illustrate how Gauss-Jordan elimination can be used to solve a traffic flow problem, consider the following example:

Suppose we have a network of four intersections, labeled A, B, C, and D. The traffic flow rates between the intersections are shown in the following table:

| From | To | Traffic flow rate (vehicles per hour) |
|---|---|---|
| A | B | 100 |
| A | C | 200 |
| B | C | 150 |
| B | D | 250 |
| C | D | 100 |

We want to determine the traffic flow rate between intersections A and D.

To solve this problem, we can construct the following system of linear equations:

```
x1 + x2 = 100
x1 + x3 = 200
x2 + x3 = 150
x2 + x4 = 250
x3 + x4 = 100
```

where x1, x2, x3, and x4 are the traffic flow rates between intersections A and B, B and C, B and D, and C and D, respectively.

We can then use Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve this system of linear equations. The following table shows the steps involved:

| Step | Matrix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ |
| 2 | $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ |
| 3 | $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ |
| 4 | $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ |
| 5 | $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ |

The reduced row echelon form of the matrix is shown in the last row of the table. From this, we can see that the traffic flow rate between intersections A and D is 100 vehicles per hour.

Gauss-Jordan elimination is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of traffic flow problems. It is a relatively simple technique to learn and use, and it can be implemented in a variety of programming languages.
