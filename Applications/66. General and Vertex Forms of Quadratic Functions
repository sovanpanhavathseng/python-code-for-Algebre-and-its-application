**General Form of Quadratic Functions**

The general form of a quadratic function is:

```
y = ax^2 + bx + c
```

where a, b, and c are real numbers and a â‰  0.

This form is useful for solving quadratic equations and finding the roots of a parabola. However, it can be difficult to interpret the graph of a quadratic function from this form.

**Vertex Form of Quadratic Functions**

The vertex form of a quadratic function is:

```
y = a(x - h)^2 + k
```

where a, h, and k are real numbers and (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola.

This form is more useful for interpreting the graph of a quadratic function, because the vertex of the parabola is the point where the function changes direction.

**Conversion Between General and Vertex Forms**

To convert a quadratic function from general form to vertex form, we can use the process of completing the square. This process involves adding a constant term to both sides of the equation so that the left-hand side can be factored as a perfect square trinomial.

For example, to convert the quadratic function y = 2x^2 - 4x + 5 to vertex form, we would first move the constant term to the right-hand side of the equation:

```
y = 2x^2 - 4x - 5
```

Next, we would factor out a 2 from the left-hand side:

```
y = 2(x^2 - 2x) - 5
```

Then, we would complete the square by adding (1/2)^2 = 1/4 to both sides of the equation:

```
y = 2(x^2 - 2x + 1/4) - 5 - 1/4
```

Finally, we would factor the left-hand side as a perfect square trinomial:

```
y = 2(x - 1)^2 - 9/4
```

This is the vertex form of the quadratic function, and we can see that the vertex of the parabola is (1, -9/4).

**Applications of Quadratic Functions**

Quadratic functions have many applications in the real world. For example, they can be used to model the following:

* The trajectory of a projectile
* The cost of producing a certain number of items
* The area of a rectangle with a given perimeter
* The profit of a company as a function of the number of units sold

Quadratic functions can also be used to solve optimization problems, such as finding the maximum or minimum value of a function.

Here is an example of an application of a quadratic function:

A company produces widgets. The cost of producing x widgets is given by the quadratic function:

```
C(x) = 2x^2 + 40x + 1000
```

To find the number of widgets that the company should produce to minimize the cost, we can set the derivative of C(x) equal to zero and solve for x:

```
C'(x) = 4x + 40 = 0
x = -10
```

However, producing a negative number of widgets is not possible, so the minimum cost is achieved when the company produces 0 widgets.

This is just one example of the many ways that quadratic functions can be used to model real-world phenomena and solve problems.
