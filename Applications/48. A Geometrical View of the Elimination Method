The elimination method is a technique for solving systems of linear equations. It can be viewed geometrically as a process of transforming the lines or planes that represent the equations in the system until one of the variables is eliminated.

For example, consider the system of two equations:

```
x + y = 3
x - y = 1
```

This system can be represented geometrically by two lines in the x-y plane. The first equation, x + y = 3, represents the line that passes through the points (0, 3) and (3, 0). The second equation, x - y = 1, represents the line that passes through the points (1, 0) and (2, 1).

To solve the system of equations using the elimination method, we can add the two equations together. This gives us the equation:

```
2x = 4
```

Dividing both sides of this equation by 2, we get x = 2. We can now substitute this value into either of the original equations to solve for y.

For example, substituting x = 2 into the first equation, we get:

```
2 + y = 3
```

Subtracting 2 from both sides of this equation, we get y = 1.

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 2 and y = 1.

Geometrically, the elimination method corresponds to the following transformation of the lines representing the equations in the system:

```
x + y = 3 -> x - y = 1 -> 2x = 4
```

The first transformation simply moves the line x + y = 3 up by one unit. The second transformation scales the line x - y = 1 by a factor of two. The third transformation shifts the line 2x = 4 to the left by two units.

The final line, 2x = 4, represents the solution to the system of equations, since it is the only line that passes through the point (2, 1).

The elimination method can also be used to solve systems of equations with more than two variables. In this case, the elimination method is used to eliminate one variable at a time until the system is reduced to a single equation with a single variable.

Here is an example of how to use the elimination method to solve a system of three equations with three variables:

```
x + 2y + 3z = 4
2x + y - z = 5
x - y + z = 6
```

To solve this system, we can first eliminate x from the second and third equations by subtracting the first equation from each equation. This gives us the equations:

```
y - z = 1
-3y + 2z = 2
```

We can then eliminate y from the third equation by adding three times the second equation to it. This gives us the equation:

```
5z = 8
```

Dividing both sides of this equation by 5, we get z = 8/5. We can now substitute this value into either of the first two equations to solve for x and y.

For example, substituting z = 8/5 into the first equation, we get:

```
x + 2y + 3(8/5) = 4
```

Solving for x, we get x = -18/5. We can then substitute x = -18/5 and z = 8/5 into the second equation to solve for y.

This gives us y = -7/5.

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = -18/5, y = -7/5, and z = 8/5.

Geometrically, the elimination method corresponds to the following transformation of the planes representing the equations in the system:

```
x + 2y + 3z = 4 -> y - z = 1 -> -3y + 2z = 2 -> 5z = 8
```

The first transformation simply moves the plane x + 2y + 3z = 4 up by one unit in the y-z direction. The second transformation rotates the plane y - z = 1 around the y-axis by 180 degrees. The third transformation scales the plane -3y + 2z = 2 by a factor of 5. The fourth transformation shifts the plane 5z = 8 to the right by 8/5 units.

The final plane, 5z = 8, represents the solution to the system of equations, since it is the only plane that passes through the point (0, -7/5, 8/5).
