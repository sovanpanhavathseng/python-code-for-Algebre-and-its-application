The elimination method is a technique for solving systems of linear equations. It works by adding or subtracting the equations in such a way that one of the variables is eliminated.

To solve a system of equations by elimination, you can follow these steps:

1. Write both equations in standard form.
2. Make the coefficients of one variable opposites.
3. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.
4. Solve for the remaining variable.
5. Substitute the solution from Step 4 into one of the original equations to find the value of the other variable.

For example, let's solve the system of equations:

```
x + y = 5
2x - y = 3
```

The first step is to write both equations in standard form. The first equation is already in standard form, but the second equation needs to be subtracted by y from both sides:

```
2x - y = 3
```
```
2x - y - y = 3 - y
```
```
2x - 2y = 3 - y
```

Now, the coefficients of y are opposites, so we can add the equations to eliminate y.

```
x + y = 5
```
```
+ 2x - 2y = 3 - y
```
```
3x = 8
```

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 8/3.

Substituting this value into the first equation, we get (8/3) + y = 5. Solving for y, we get y = 1/3.

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 8/3, y = 1/3.

The elimination method can be used to solve any system of linear equations, but it is most efficient when the coefficients of one variable are opposites. It can also be used to solve systems of equations with more than two variables.

Here are some applications of the elimination method:

* In physics, the elimination method can be used to solve systems of equations that represent physical laws. For example, it can be used to solve the equations for motion of a projectile.
* In engineering, the elimination method can be used to solve systems of equations that represent structural or electrical systems. For example, it can be used to solve the equations for the stress and strain in a beam.
* In economics, the elimination method can be used to solve systems of equations that represent economic models. For example, it can be used to solve the equations for supply and demand in a market.

The elimination method is a powerful tool for solving systems of linear equations. It is easy to understand and use, and it can be applied to a wide variety of problems.
