Multiplication with complex numbers is the process of multiplying two or more complex numbers. It is done using the distributive property of multiplication.

**To multiply two complex numbers z and w, follow these steps:**

1. Expand the product using the distributive property:

```
(a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi^2
```

2. Simplify the product by combining the real and imaginary terms:

```
(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
```

**Example:**

```
Multiply the complex numbers z = 3 + 2i and w = 1 + 4i.

```
(3 + 2i)(1 + 4i) = 3 + 12i + 2i + 8i^2
```
```
= 3 + 14i - 8
```
```
= -5 + 14i


**Applications of complex number multiplication:**

Complex number multiplication is used in a variety of fields, including:

* Electrical engineering: Complex number multiplication is used to analyze and design electrical circuits.
* Quantum mechanics: Complex number multiplication is used to describe the behavior of quantum particles.
* Signal processing: Complex number multiplication is used to process signals such as audio and images.
* Computer science: Complex number multiplication is used in a variety of algorithms, such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT).

Here are a few specific examples of how complex number multiplication is used in the real world:

* **Analyzing the behavior of electrical circuits:** When an alternating current (AC) flows through an electrical circuit, the voltage and current can be represented by complex numbers. Complex number multiplication can be used to calculate the impedance of the circuit, which is a measure of how the circuit opposes the flow of current.
* **Designing antennas:** Complex number multiplication is used to design antennas that can efficiently transmit and receive radio waves.
* **Processing medical images:** Complex number multiplication is used to process medical images such as MRI scans and CT scans. This can help doctors to better diagnose and treat diseases.
* **Developing new drugs:** Complex number multiplication is used to develop new drugs by simulating the behavior of molecules. This can help scientists to identify drugs that are likely to be effective and safe.

Overall, complex number multiplication is a powerful tool that is used in a wide variety of fields.
