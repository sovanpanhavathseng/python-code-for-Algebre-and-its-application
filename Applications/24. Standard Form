Standard form, also known as scientific notation, is a way of writing very large or very small numbers in a way that makes them easier to read and write. A number in standard form is written as follows:

```
a × 10ⁿ
```

where:

* a is a real number between 1 and 10, inclusive
* n is an integer

The number a is called the significand, and the power of 10 is called the exponent. The exponent tells how many places the decimal point is moved to the right to get from the original number to the standard form number.

For example, the number 1,234,567,890 can be written in standard form as 1.23456789 × 10⁸. This means that the decimal point is moved 8 places to the right to get from 1,234,567,890 to 1.23456789.

Standard form is used in many different areas of science and engineering. For example, it is used to express the speed of light, the distance between galaxies, and the size of atoms. It is also used in computer science to represent large numbers.

Here are some of the benefits of using standard form:

* It makes it easier to read and write very large or very small numbers.
* It makes it easier to compare different numbers that are on different scales.
* It is a standard way of writing these numbers, so it is easy to communicate them to others.
* វាធ្វើឱ្យវាកាន់តែងាយស្រួលក្នុងការអាន និងសរសេរលេខធំ ឬតូចបំផុត។
* វាធ្វើឱ្យវាកាន់តែងាយស្រួលក្នុងការប្រៀបធៀបលេខផ្សេងគ្នាដែលមាននៅលើមាត្រដ្ឋានផ្សេងគ្នា។
* វាជាវិធីស្ដង់ដារនៃការសរសេរលេខទាំងនេះ ដូច្នេះវាងាយស្រួលក្នុងការទំនាក់ទំនងពួកគេទៅកាន់អ្នកដទៃ។

Here are some examples of the application of standard form:

* The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second, which can be written in standard form as 2.99792458 × 10⁸ meters per second.
* The distance between the Earth and the Sun is 149,600,000 kilometers, which can be written in standard form as 1.496 × 10⁸ kilometers.
* The size of an atom is about 0.0000000001 meters, which can be written in standard form as 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ meters.

Standard form is a powerful tool that can be used to represent very large or very small numbers in a way that is easy to read, write, and communicate. It is used in many different areas of science and engineering, and it is a valuable skill to have.
