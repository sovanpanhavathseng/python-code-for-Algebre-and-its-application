Multiplying polynomial functions is a process of combining two polynomials to produce a new polynomial. It is a fundamental operation in algebra and has many applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and engineering.

**Steps to multiply polynomial functions:**

1. **Distribute the first polynomial over the second polynomial.** This means multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.
2. **Combine like terms.** Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. For example, 2x^2 and 3x^2 are like terms, while 2x^2 and 3x are not.
3. **Simplify the resulting polynomial.** This may involve combining like terms further, canceling out common factors, and/or collecting constant terms.

**Example:**

To multiply the polynomials (2x^2 + x - 3) and (x^2 - 2x + 5), we would first distribute the first polynomial over the second polynomial:

```
(2x^2 + x - 3) * (x^2 - 2x + 5) =
2x^2 * (x^2 - 2x + 5) + x * (x^2 - 2x + 5) - 3 * (x^2 - 2x + 5)
```

Then, we would combine like terms:

```
= 2x^4 - 4x^3 + 10x^2 + x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 3x^2 + 6x - 15
```

Finally, we would simplify the resulting polynomial by combining like terms further:

```
= 2x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x - 15
```

**Applications of multiplying polynomial functions:**

Multiplying polynomial functions has many applications in various fields, including:

* **Mathematics:** Multiplying polynomial functions is used in many areas of mathematics, such as calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. For example, it is used to solve polynomial equations, find the derivatives of polynomial functions, and integrate polynomial functions.
* **Physics:** Multiplying polynomial functions is used in many areas of physics, such as mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. For example, it is used to calculate the forces between objects, the energy of a system, and the probability of a quantum event.
* **Engineering:** Multiplying polynomial functions is used in many areas of engineering, such as electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering. For example, it is used to design electrical circuits, mechanical systems, and structures.

Here are some specific examples of applications of multiplying polynomial functions:

* In electrical engineering, multiplying polynomial functions is used to design filters, which are circuits that can select or reject certain frequencies of an electrical signal.
* In mechanical engineering, multiplying polynomial functions is used to design control systems, which are systems that can automatically control the behavior of a machine.
* In civil engineering, multiplying polynomial functions is used to design bridges and other structures, to ensure that they can withstand the forces that will be applied to them.

Overall, multiplying polynomial functions is a powerful tool that has many applications in various fields.
