In mathematics, an interval is a set of real numbers that is defined by two numbers, called the endpoints of the interval. The endpoints can be either included or excluded from the interval, depending on whether the interval is open or closed.

A bounded interval is an interval that has both a finite lower bound and a finite upper bound. In other words, there are two real numbers such that all the numbers in the interval are greater than or equal to the lower bound and less than or equal to the upper bound.

An unbounded interval is an interval that does not have a finite lower bound or a finite upper bound. In other words, the interval either goes on forever to the left or to the right, or it goes on forever in both directions.

Here are some examples of bounded intervals:

* The interval [-1, 3] is bounded by -1 and 3. All the numbers in this interval are greater than or equal to -1 and less than or equal to 3.
* The interval (0, 1) is bounded by 0 and 1. All the numbers in this interval are greater than 0 and less than 1.

Here are some examples of unbounded intervals:

* The interval (-infinity, 3] is unbounded on the left. It includes all the numbers less than or equal to 3, and it goes on forever to the left.
* The interval (0, infinity) is unbounded on the right. It includes all the numbers greater than 0, and it goes on forever to the right.
* The interval (-infinity, infinity) is unbounded on both ends. It includes all the real numbers.

Bounded and unbounded intervals have different applications in mathematics. Bounded intervals are often used to represent sets of real numbers that have a finite size. For example, the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1 is a bounded interval. Unbounded intervals are often used to represent sets of real numbers that have an infinite size. For example, the set of all real numbers greater than 0 is an unbounded interval.

In addition to their mathematical applications, bounded and unbounded intervals are also used in computer science. For example, they are used to represent sets of data in databases. Bounded intervals are often used to represent sets of data that have a finite size, while unbounded intervals are often used to represent sets of data that have an infinite size.

Here are some additional examples of the application of bounded and unbounded intervals:

* In physics, bounded intervals are often used to represent the possible values of physical quantities. For example, the possible values of the position of a particle in a box are bounded by the length of the box.
* In economics, bounded intervals are often used to represent the possible values of economic variables. For example, the possible values of the price of a stock are bounded by the minimum and maximum prices that the stock has ever traded for.
* In statistics, bounded intervals are often used to represent confidence intervals. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter. The width of the confidence interval depends on the sample size and the confidence level.
