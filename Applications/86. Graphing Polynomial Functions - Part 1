Polynomial functions are an important type of function in mathematics. They have many applications in science, engineering, and other fields. For example, polynomial functions are used to model the motion of objects, the growth of populations, and the behavior of electrical circuits.

One of the most important applications of polynomial functions is in graphing. Graphing polynomial functions can help us to understand their behavior and to solve problems involving them.

**Steps for Graphing Polynomial Functions**

1. **Find the intercepts.** The intercepts are the points where the graph of the function crosses the x-axis and the y-axis. To find the x-intercepts, set the function equal to zero and solve for x. To find the y-intercept, set x equal to zero and evaluate the function.
2. **Check for symmetry.** A function is even if f(-x) = f(x) and odd if f(-x) = -f(x). Even functions are symmetrical about the y-axis, and odd functions are symmetrical about the origin.
3. **Use the multiplicities of the zeros to determine the behavior of the polynomial at the x-intercepts.** The multiplicity of a zero is the number of times that the zero appears in the factored form of the polynomial. A zero with a multiplicity of 1 is called a single zero, a zero with a multiplicity of 2 is called a double zero, and so on.

    * If a zero has an odd multiplicity, then the graph of the function crosses the x-axis at that point.
    * If a zero has an even multiplicity, then the graph of the function touches the x-axis at that point and then turns around.

4. **Determine the end behavior by examining the leading term.** The leading term is the term with the highest exponent in the polynomial. If the leading term is positive, then the graph of the function rises to the right. If the leading term is negative, then the graph of the function falls to the right.
5. **Use the end behavior and the behavior at the intercepts to sketch the graph.**

**Application of Graphing Polynomial Functions**

Graphing polynomial functions can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, we can use graphs to:

* Find the maximum and minimum values of a function.
* Solve inequalities.
* Determine the intervals where a function is increasing or decreasing.
* Find the roots of a polynomial.
* Model real-world phenomena.

Here is an example of how to use graphing to solve a problem:

**Problem:** Find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1.

**Solution:**

1. **Find the intercepts.**

The x-intercepts occur when f(x) = 0. So, we need to solve the equation:

```
x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
```

This equation can be factored as:

```
(x - 1)(x^2 - 2x - 1) = 0
```

Therefore, the x-intercepts are x = 1 and x = 1 +/- sqrt(2). The y-intercept occurs when x = 0, so the y-intercept is f(0) = 1.

2. **Check for symmetry.**

The function f(x) is not even or odd, so it does not have any symmetry.

3. **Use the multiplicities of the zeros to determine the behavior of the polynomial at the x-intercepts.**

The zero x = 1 has a multiplicity of 1, so the graph of the function crosses the x-axis at this point. The zeros x = 1 +/- sqrt(2) each have a multiplicity of 1, so the graph of the function also crosses the x-axis at these points.

4. **Determine the end behavior by examining the leading term.**

The leading term of the polynomial is x^3, which is positive. Therefore, the graph of the function rises to the right.

5. **Use the end behavior and the behavior at the intercepts to sketch the graph.**

The following graph shows the sketch of the graph of the function f(x):

[Plot of f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1]

From the graph, we can see that the maximum value of the function occurs at x = 1, and the minimum value of the function occurs at x = 1 + sqrt(2).

This is just one example of how graphing polynomial functions can be used to solve problems. Graphing polynomial functions is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in mathematics and science.
