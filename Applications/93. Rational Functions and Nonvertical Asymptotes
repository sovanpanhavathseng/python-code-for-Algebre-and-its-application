Rational functions and nonvertical asymptotes are important concepts in mathematics with many real-world applications.

**Rational Functions and Nonvertical Asymptotes**

A rational function is any function that can be written as the ratio of two polynomials. For example, the function $f(x)=\frac{x}{x-1}$ is a rational function.

A nonvertical asymptote of a rational function is a horizontal or oblique line that the graph of the function approaches as the $x$-value approaches positive or negative infinity. Nonvertical asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator of the rational function.

To find the nonvertical asymptotes of a rational function, we can divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of $x$ in the denominator. The resulting quotient is the equation of the nonvertical asymptote.

**Applications of Rational Functions and Nonvertical Asymptotes**

Rational functions and nonvertical asymptotes are used in many different areas of mathematics and science. For example, rational functions can be used to model the following:

* The concentration of a chemical in a solution over time
* The population of a species over time
* The cost of producing a certain number of items at a large scale

Nonvertical asymptotes can be used to understand the behavior of these models as the $x$-value approaches positive or negative infinity. For example, the nonvertical asymptote of the function that models the concentration of a chemical in a solution over time tells us that the concentration of the chemical will eventually reach a constant value.

Here are some specific examples of how rational functions and nonvertical asymptotes are used in real-world applications:

* **Chemistry:** Rational functions can be used to model the concentration of reactants and products in a chemical reaction. Nonvertical asymptotes can be used to predict the equilibrium concentration of the reactants and products.
* **Biology:** Rational functions can be used to model the population of a species over time. Nonvertical asymptotes can be used to predict the carrying capacity of the environment for the species.
* **Economics:** Rational functions can be used to model the cost of producing a certain number of items at a large scale. Nonvertical asymptotes can be used to predict the long-run average cost of producing the items.

**Conclusion**

Rational functions and nonvertical asymptotes are important concepts in mathematics with many real-world applications. By understanding these concepts, we can better understand and model the world around us.
