I found a video on **YouTube** that examines an example of Gauss-Jordan elimination on a dependent system from Algebra chapter 58, and follows how the planes are geometrically transformed step by step, from a system of three planes, representing three equations, each containing three variables, to a system of two planes representing two equations, each containing only two variables. The result is a simpler system from which a parametric representation of the infinite solution set can then be easily written ¹. 

I also found a **PDF** file that explains how to solve a dependent system of equations by using the Gauss-Jordan method. It includes examples and detailed explanations ².

I hope this helps!
