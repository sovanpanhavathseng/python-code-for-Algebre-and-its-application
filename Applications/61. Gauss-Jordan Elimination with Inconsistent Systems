Gauss-Jordan elimination is a method used to solve systems of linear equations. It involves a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. The goal is to write the matrix with the number 1 as the entry down the main diagonal and have all zeros above and below. This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix ⁶. 

An inconsistent system is one that has no solution. Inconsistent systems can arise when using Gauss-Jordan elimination. For example, if we have two equations and three unknowns, we may end up with an inconsistent system if one equation is redundant or contradictory ². 

Gauss-Jordan elimination has many applications in mathematics and engineering. It can be used to solve systems of linear equations, find the inverse of a matrix, and compute determinants ⁶. It is also used in computer graphics to transform objects in three-dimensional space ⁶. 

I hope this helps!
