A linear equation is an equation of the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are real numbers and a ≠ 0. The graph of a linear equation is a straight line.

Linear equations have many applications in the real world. For example, they can be used to model the following:

* The relationship between the cost of an item and the number of items purchased
ទំនាក់ទំនងរវាងថ្លៃដើមនៃវត្ថុមួយ និងចំនួនវត្ថុដែលបានទិញ
* The distance traveled by an object over time
ចម្ងាយធ្វើដំណើរដោយវត្ថុតាមពេលវេលា
* The amount of money in a bank account over time
ចំនួនប្រាក់នៅក្នុងគណនីធនាគារតាមពេលវេលា
* The number of bacteria in a culture over time
ចំនួននៃបាក់តេរីនៅក្នុងវប្បធម៌មួយតាមពេលវេលា

Linear equations can also be used to solve problems. For example, they can be used to find the following:

* The cost of 10 items
* The time it takes to travel 100 miles
* The amount of money in a bank account after 1 year
* The number of bacteria in a culture after 1 day
* តម្លៃនៃវត្ថុចំនួន 10
* ពេលវេលាដែលត្រូវធ្វើដំណើរ 100 ម៉ាយ
* ចំនួនប្រាក់នៅក្នុងគណនីធនាគារបន្ទាប់ពី 1 ឆ្នាំ។
* ចំនួនបាក់តេរីក្នុងវប្បធម៌មួយបន្ទាប់ពី 1 ថ្ងៃ។

Linear equations are a powerful tool that can be used to model and solve problems in many different areas.

Here are some other examples of linear equations and their applications:

* The equation y = mx + b, where m and b are constants, represents a line with slope m and y-intercept b. This equation can be used to model the relationship between two variables, such as the height and weight of people or the price and demand for a product.
* The equation d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate of speed, and t is the time traveled, can be used to model the distance traveled by an object over time.
* The equation P = A * e^-rt, where P is the population of a bacteria culture, A is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time, can be used to model the growth of a bacteria culture over time.
