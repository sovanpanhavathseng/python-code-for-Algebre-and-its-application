A percentage is a number or ratio that can be expressed as a fraction of 100. It is a convenient way to express parts of a whole. For example, 50% is equivalent to 50/100 = 0.5, which means 50 out of 100.

Percentages are used in a variety of applications, including:

* **Calculating discounts and sales tax:** When you buy an item on sale, the discount is often expressed as a percentage. For example, if an item is on sale for 20% off, that means you are paying 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.
* **Measuring performance:** Percentages can be used to measure performance in a variety of areas, such as sales, customer satisfaction, and employee productivity. For example, a company might track its sales growth by calculating the percentage increase in sales from one year to the next.
* **Making comparisons:** Percentages can be used to make comparisons between different values. For example, you could compare the percentage of students who passed an exam in two different classes.
* **Communicating data:** Percentages are a clear and concise way to communicate data. For example, you could report that 60% of employees are satisfied with their jobs.
