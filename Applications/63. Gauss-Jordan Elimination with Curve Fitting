Gauss-Jordan elimination is a technique used to solve systems of linear equations. It is an extension of Gaussian elimination and is used to find the reduced row echelon form of a matrix. The method involves performing elementary row operations on the matrix until it is in the desired form. 

Curve fitting is the process of finding a mathematical function that best fits a set of data points. One application of Gauss-Jordan elimination is to find a polynomial function whose graph passes through a given set of data points ⁵. In some cases, the system can have a single unique solution corresponding to a single unique function which includes the points, infinitely many solutions which correspond to infinitely many functions which include the points, or no solution ⁵.

The following video ⁵ provides an example of how Gauss-Jordan elimination can be used to solve systems of linear equations with four or more variables and find a polynomial function that passes through a given set of data points.

I hope this helps!
