In mathematics, the **Cartesian product** of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x belongs to A and y belongs to B. It is denoted by A × B.

For example, if A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4, 5}, then the Cartesian product of A and B is {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}.

An **ordered pair** is a pair of elements (x, y) where x and y are from two different sets. The order of the elements in the pair is important, so (x, y) is not the same as (y, x).

For example, the ordered pair (1, 3) is different from the ordered pair (3, 1).

A **triple** is a generalization of an ordered pair. It is a set of three elements (x, y, z) where x, y, and z are from three different sets. The order of the elements in the triple is important, so (x, y, z) is not the same as (y, x, z) or (z, x, y).

For example, the triple (1, 3, 5) is different from the triple (3, 1, 5) or (5, 3, 1).

Cartesian products, ordered pairs, and triples are all used in mathematics to represent relationships between sets. They are also used in computer science to represent data structures and algorithms.

Here are some additional properties of Cartesian products:

* The Cartesian product of two sets is always non-empty.
* The Cartesian product of two sets is commutative, meaning that A × B = B × A.
* The Cartesian product of two sets is associative, meaning that (A × B) × C = A × (B × C).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
