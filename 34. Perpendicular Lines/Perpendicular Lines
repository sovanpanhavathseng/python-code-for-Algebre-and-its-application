Perpendicular lines are two lines that intersect at a right angle, or 90 degrees. The word "perpendicular" comes from the Latin word "perpendicularis," which means "dropped perpendicularly."

**Properties of Perpendicular Lines**

* Perpendicular lines always intersect at a right angle, or 90 degrees.
* The two acute angles at the point of intersection of perpendicular lines are always congruent.
* The product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is always equal to -1.
* The perpendicular symbol (âŸ‚) is used to indicate that two lines are perpendicular.

**Examples of Perpendicular Lines**

* The lines that form the corners of a square or rectangle are perpendicular.
* The lines that form the corners of a right triangle are perpendicular.
* The lines that form the letter "L" are perpendicular.

**Difference Between Parallel and Perpendicular Lines**

Parallel lines are lines that never intersect, and they are always the same distance apart. Perpendicular lines are lines that always intersect each other at right angles.

**Applications of Perpendicular Lines**

Perpendicular lines are used in many different applications, including:

* Construction: Perpendicular lines are used to construct right angles, which are essential for many types of construction projects.
* Engineering: Perpendicular lines are used in engineering to design structures that are strong and stable.
* Mathematics: Perpendicular lines are used in many different areas of mathematics, including geometry, trigonometry, and calculus.

**Conclusion**

Perpendicular lines are an important concept in geometry and mathematics. They are used in many different applications, and they have many interesting properties.
