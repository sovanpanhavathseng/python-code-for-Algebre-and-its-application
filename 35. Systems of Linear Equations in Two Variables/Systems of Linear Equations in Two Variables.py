// This code first defines a function called solve_system() that takes in the coefficients of the two equations and the constant terms, and returns the solution to the system. The function then uses the substitution method to solve for the two variables. Finally, the code calls the solve_system() function with some specific values for the coefficients and constant terms, and prints the solution.

// To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as solve_system.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
