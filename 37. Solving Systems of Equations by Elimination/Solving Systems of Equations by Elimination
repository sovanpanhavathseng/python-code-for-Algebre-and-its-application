The elimination method is a technique for solving systems of linear equations. It works by adding or subtracting the equations in such a way that one of the variables is eliminated.

To solve a system of equations by elimination, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Write both equations in standard form.
2. Make the coefficients of one variable opposites.
3. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.
4. Solve for the remaining variable.
5. Substitute the solution from Step 4 into one of the original equations to solve for the other variable.
6. Check that the ordered pair you found is a solution to both original equations.

Here is an example of how to solve a system of equations by elimination:

```
Equation 1: 2x + y = 5
Equation 2: x - y = 2
```

First, we need to make the coefficients of one variable opposites. In this case, we can make the coefficients of y opposites by multiplying Equation 1 by 1 and Equation 2 by 1. This gives us:

```
Equation 1: 2x + y = 5
Equation 2: x - y = 2
```

Now, we can add the equations to eliminate y. This gives us:

```
3x = 7
```

Solving for x, we get x = 7/3. We can then substitute this value into Equation 1 to solve for y. This gives us:

```
2(7/3) + y = 5
```

```
14/3 + y = 5
```

```
y = 1/3
```

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (7/3, 1/3).

Here are some tips for solving systems of equations by elimination:

* Make sure that the equations are in standard form before you start.
* Pay attention to the signs of the coefficients when you are adding or subtracting the equations.
* If you find that you cannot eliminate one of the variables, try multiplying one or both equations by a different number.
* Check your solution by substituting the values you found for x and y into both original equations.
