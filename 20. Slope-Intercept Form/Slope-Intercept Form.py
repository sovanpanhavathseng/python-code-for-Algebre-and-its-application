// This code first defines a function called slope_intercept(). This function takes two arguments: the slope of the line and the y-intercept. The function then returns the slope-intercept form of the line as a string.

// The main function of the code sets the slope and y-intercept of the line. Then, it calls the slope_intercept() function and prints the result.

// To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as slope_intercept.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
