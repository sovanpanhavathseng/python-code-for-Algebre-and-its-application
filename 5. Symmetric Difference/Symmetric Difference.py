// This code first defines a function called symmetric_difference() that takes two sets as input and returns the symmetric difference of the two sets. The function works by first getting the union and intersection of the two sets. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set, or in both sets. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are in both sets.

// The function then returns the union of the two sets, minus the intersection of the two sets. This is the symmetric difference of the two sets.

// The code then defines two sets, set1 and set2, and then calls the symmetric_difference() function on these two sets. The function prints the output of the symmetric_difference() function, which is the set of all elements that are in either set1 or set2, but not in both sets.

// To run the code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as symmetric_difference.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
