Slope is a measure of the steepness of a line. It is calculated as the ratio of the "vertical change" to the "horizontal change" between any two distinct points on a line. Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient ("rise over run"), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line. A line that is decreasing has a negative "rise".

The slope of a line can be positive, negative, zero, or undefined. A positive slope means that the line is going up as you move to the right, a negative slope means that the line is going down as you move to the right, a zero slope means that the line is horizontal, and an undefined slope means that the line is vertical.

The slope of a line can be used to find the equation of the line, and the equation of a line can be used to find the slope of the line.

Here are some examples of slopes:

* A line with a slope of 1 goes up 1 unit for every 1 unit to the right.
* A line with a slope of -1 goes down 1 unit for every 1 unit to the right.
* A line with a slope of 0 is horizontal.
* A line with an undefined slope is vertical.

The slope of a line can be used to measure many things in the real world, such as the steepness of a hill, the rate of change of a function, or the direction of a vector.
