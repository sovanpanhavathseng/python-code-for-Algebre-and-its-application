A scatter plot is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. If the points are coded (color/shape/size), one additional variable can be displayed. The data are displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis.

A scatter plot can suggest various kinds of correlations between variables with a certain confidence interval. For example, weight and height would be on the y-axis, and height would be on the x-axis. Correlations may be positive (rising), negative (falling), or null (uncorrelated). If the dots' pattern slopes from lower left to upper right, it indicates a positive correlation between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots slopes from upper left to lower right, it indicates a negative correlation. A line of best fit (alternatively called 'trendline') can be drawn to study the relationship between the variables.

Here are some of the uses of scatter plots:

* To observe and show relationships between two numeric variables.
* To identify correlational relationships.
* To predict the value of one variable based on the value of another variable.
* To compare different groups of data.
* To identify outliers.

Here are some of the different types of scatter plots:

* **Positive correlation:** The dots in the scatter plot form a line that slopes upwards from left to right. This indicates that as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable also increases.
* **Negative correlation:** The dots in the scatter plot form a line that slopes downwards from left to right. This indicates that as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable decreases.
* **No correlation:** The dots in the scatter plot are scattered randomly. This indicates that there is no relationship between the two variables.

Scatter plots are a powerful tool for visualizing data and identifying relationships between variables. They are easy to understand and can be used to communicate findings to a variety of audiences.
