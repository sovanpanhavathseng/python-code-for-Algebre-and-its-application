The elimination method works because of the **Addition Property of Equality**. This property states that if you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, the two sides will still be equal.

In the elimination method, we add or subtract the equations in such a way that the coefficients of one variable are equal on opposite sides of the equations. When we do this, we can simply **eliminate** that variable from the equations.

For example, consider the system of equations:

```
x + y = 5
2x - y = 3
```

We can eliminate the variable `y` by adding the equations together. When we do this, we get:

```
3x = 8
```

Solving for `x`, we get `x = 8/3`. We can then substitute this value of `x` into either of the original equations to solve for `y`.

In this case, substituting `x = 8/3` into the first equation gives us `(8/3) + y = 5`, so `y = 1/3`.

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is `(x, y) = (8/3, 1/3)`.

The elimination method can be used to solve any system of linear equations, as long as the equations have a unique solution. If the equations have infinitely many solutions, or no solutions, the elimination method will not work.

Here are some tips for using the elimination method:

* Make sure that the coefficients of the variable you want to eliminate are opposites. If they are not, you can multiply one or both equations by a constant to make them opposites.
* Be careful when adding or subtracting the equations. Make sure that you are adding or subtracting the corresponding terms on each side of the equations.
* If you get stuck, try solving for one variable in terms of the other, and then substituting that value into the other equation.

The elimination method is a simple and effective way to solve systems of linear equations. With a little practice, you will be able to use it to solve any system of linear equations that you encounter.
