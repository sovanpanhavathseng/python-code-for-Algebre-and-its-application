Percentage problems can be solved using linear equations. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Write the percentage as a decimal or fraction.**
2. **Let x be the unknown quantity.**
3. **Set up an equation that expresses the given information in terms of x.**
4. **Solve the equation for x.**
5. **Check your answer by substituting it back into the original equation.**

Here is an example of a percentage problem that can be solved using a linear equation:

* **Problem:** A store increases the price of a shirt by 20%. If the original price of the shirt was $50, what is the new price?

* **Solution:** First, we convert the 20% increase to a decimal or fraction. 20% = 20/100 = 0.2.
* **Let x be the new price of the shirt.**
* **We know that the original price of the shirt was $50, and that the price increased by 20%.** So, we can set up the following equation:

```
50 + 0.2x = x
```

* **Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:**

```
0.2x = x - 50
```

* **Subtracting x from both sides of the equation, we get:**

```
-0.8x = -50
```

* **Dividing both sides of the equation by -0.8, we get:**

```
x = $62.50
```

* **Checking our answer, we see that it satisfies the original equation.**

As you can see, solving percentage problems with linear equations is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily solve any percentage problem that you encounter.

Here are some additional tips for solving percentage problems with linear equations:

* **Make sure that you understand the meaning of the percentage given in the problem.** Is it a percentage increase, decrease, or something else?
* **Express the percentage as a decimal or fraction before you start solving the equation.** This will make the problem easier to work with.
* **Use variable names that are clear and easy to understand.** This will help you to avoid making mistakes when you are solving the equation.
* **Check your answer by substituting it back into the original equation.** This will help you to ensure that your answer is correct.
