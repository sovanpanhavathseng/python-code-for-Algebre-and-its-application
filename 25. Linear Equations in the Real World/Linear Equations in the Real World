Linear equations are a basic concept in mathematics, but they have many real-world applications. Here are some examples:

* **Computing mileage rates.** If you know the distance you travel and the number of hours you spend driving, you can use a linear equation to calculate your mileage rate. For example, if you travel 100 miles in 2 hours, your mileage rate is 50 miles per hour.
* **Estimating income over time.** If you know your current income and the rate at which your income is increasing, you can use a linear equation to estimate your income in the future. For example, if your current income is $50,000 and your income is increasing by $5,000 per year, your estimated income in 5 years is $70,000.
* **Comparing rates of pay.** If you are offered two jobs with different salaries, you can use a linear equation to compare the rates of pay. For example, if one job offers $40,000 per year and the other offers $20 per hour, you can use a linear equation to determine which job pays a higher rate.
* **Predicting profit.** If you know the cost of producing a product and the price you sell it for, you can use a linear equation to predict your profit. For example, if the cost of producing a product is $10 and you sell it for $20, your profit is $10 per product.
* **Solving geometry problems.** Linear equations can be used to solve many geometry problems, such as finding the area of a triangle or the perimeter of a rectangle.

These are just a few examples of how linear equations are used in the real world. Linear equations are a powerful tool that can be used to solve many different types of problems.

Here are some other real-world applications of linear equations:

* **Budgeting.** Linear equations can be used to create a budget and track your spending.
* **Measuring temperature conversions.** Linear equations can be used to convert between different temperature scales.
* **Computer graphics.** Linear equations are used to create 2D and 3D graphics.
* **Machine learning.** Linear equations are used in machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

As you can see, linear equations have a wide range of applications in the real world. They are a powerful tool that can be used to solve many different types of problems.
