// This code first defines a function called CartesianCoordinates() that takes three numbers as input: the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate, and the z-coordinate. The function then returns a tuple of these three numbers, which represent the Cartesian coordinates of a point in three dimensions.

// The main function of the code then defines the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate, and the z-coordinate of a point. The CartesianCoordinates() function is then called with these three numbers as input. The output of the function is then printed to the console.

// To run the code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as cartesian_coordinates.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
