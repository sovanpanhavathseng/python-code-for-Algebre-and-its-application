// These functions can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, the factorial() function can be used to calculate the factorial of a number, the sum() function can be used to calculate the sum of a list of numbers, and the average() function can be used to calculate the average of a list of numbers.

// The pow() function can be used to calculate the power of a number to another number, and the log() function can be used to calculate the logarithm of a number to another base.

// These are just a few examples of Python functions. There are many other functions that can be used to solve different kinds of problems.
