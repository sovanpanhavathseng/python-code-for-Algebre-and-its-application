// This code first defines a function called solve_linear_equation(). This function takes three arguments: the coefficients a and b, and the constant term c. The function then solves the linear equation ax + by = c and returns the solution as a tuple of (x, y).

// The main function of the code then defines the values of a, b, and c. It then calls the solve_linear_equation() function to solve the equation and prints the solution.

// To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as solve_linear_equation.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
