A real-valued function of a real variable is a function that takes a real number as input and returns a real number as output. In other words, it is a function that assigns a real number to each member of its domain, which is a subset of the set of real numbers.

For example, the function f(x) = x^2 is a real-valued function of a real variable. Its domain is all real numbers, and its range is the set of all non-negative real numbers.

Here are some other examples of real-valued functions of a real variable:

* The function f(x) = sin(x) is a real-valued function of a real variable. Its domain is all real numbers, and its range is the set of all real numbers between -1 and 1.
* The function f(x) = e^x is a real-valued function of a real variable. Its domain is all real numbers, and its range is the set of all positive real numbers.
* The function f(x) = 1/x is a real-valued function of a real variable. Its domain is all real numbers except for 0, and its range is the set of all real numbers except for 0.

Real-valued functions of a real variable are used in many different areas of mathematics and science. They are used to model physical phenomena, to solve equations, and to analyze data.

Here are some examples of how real-valued functions of a real variable are used:

* In physics, real-valued functions of a real variable are used to model the motion of objects, the flow of fluids, and the behavior of electrical circuits.
* In chemistry, real-valued functions of a real variable are used to model the behavior of molecules and the rates of chemical reactions.
* In biology, real-valued functions of a real variable are used to model the growth of populations, the spread of diseases, and the behavior of ecosystems.
* In economics, real-valued functions of a real variable are used to model the supply and demand of goods and services, the behavior of financial markets, and the growth of economies.

Real-valued functions of a real variable are a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. They are an essential part of many different fields of mathematics and science.
