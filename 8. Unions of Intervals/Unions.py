// This code first defines a function called union() that takes two sets as input and returns the union of those sets. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set, or in both sets.

// The union() function works by first creating a new set called result. Then, it iterates through the first set, a, and adds each element to result. Next, it iterates through the second set, b, and adds each element to result if it is not already in result. Finally, the union() function returns result.

// The main function of the code simply creates two sets, a and b, and then calls the union() function to find the union of those sets. The output of the code is the union of the two sets, which is the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

// You can run this code by saving it as a Python file and then running it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as union.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
