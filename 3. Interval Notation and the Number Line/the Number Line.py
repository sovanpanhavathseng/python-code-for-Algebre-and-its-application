// This code first defines a function called number_line(). This function takes two arguments: start and end. The start argument specifies the first number on the number line, and the end argument specifies the last number on the number line.

// The number_line() function then uses a for loop to iterate through all the numbers from start to end, inclusive. In each iteration of the loop, the print() function is used to print the current number.

// The number_line() function is then called with the arguments 1 and 10. This tells the function to print the numbers from 1 to 10, inclusive.

// To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as number_line.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
