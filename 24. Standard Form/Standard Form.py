Sure, here is a Python code for standard form in algebra:

python
def standard_form(a, b, c):
  """Returns the equation in standard form.

  Args:
    a: The coefficient of the x^2 term.
    b: The coefficient of the x term.
    c: The constant term.

  Returns:
    The equation in standard form.
  """

  if a == 0:
    if b == 0:
      return "0"
    else:
      return "x + {0:.2f} = 0".format(-c / b)
  else:
    return "ax^2 + {0:.2f}x + {1:.2f} = 0".format(-b / a, -c / a)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  print(standard_form(1, 2, 3))
  # Output: "x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0"

  print(standard_form(0, 1, 2))
  # Output: "x + 2 = 0"

  print(standard_form(0, 0, 1))
  # Output: "1 = 0"


This code first checks if the coefficient of the x^2 term, a, is equal to 0. If it is, then the equation is either a linear equation or a constant equation. If a is not equal to 0, then the code returns the equation in standard form, with the coefficients of the x and x^2 terms formatted to two decimal places.

The code also defines a main function that takes three arguments: the coefficients of the x^2, x, and constant terms. The main function then calls the standard_form() function to get the equation in standard form, and prints the result.

To run the code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as standard_form.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:


python standard_form.py


This will print the output of the code to the console.
