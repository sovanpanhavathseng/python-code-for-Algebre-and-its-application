Standard form is a way of writing numbers in a way that makes them easier to compare and understand. It is written as follows:

```
a × 10ⁿ
```

where:

* a is a real number between 1 and 10
* n is an integer

For example, the number 123,000,000 in standard form is written as:

```
1.23 × 10⁸
```

This means that the number is equal to 1.23 multiplied by 10 to the power of 8, which is equal to 123,000,000.

There are a few rules that you need to follow when writing numbers in standard form:

* The first digit of a in standard form must be between 1 and 10.
* The exponent n must be a positive or negative integer.
* If the exponent is positive, it tells you how many times you need to move the decimal point to the right.
* If the exponent is negative, it tells you how many times you need to move the decimal point to the left.

Here are some more examples of numbers written in standard form:

* 1,000,000 = 1 × 10⁶
* 0.0001 = 1 × 10⁻³
* 123,456 = 1.23456 × 10⁵

I hope this helps!
