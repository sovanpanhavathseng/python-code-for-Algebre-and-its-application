//This code will create a Venn diagram with three circles, each representing a different set. The sizes of the circles will be proportional to the number of elements in each set. The colors of the circles will be red, green, and blue. The alpha value for the filled areas of the circles will be 0.5, which means that they will be partially transparent.

//The code will also add labels to the circles, which will be the names of the sets. The labels will be placed at the top of the circles, and they will be slightly offset to the right.

//The code will then show the Venn diagram.

//To run this code, you will need to have the matplotlib and matplotlib_venn libraries installed. You can install them with the following commands:
