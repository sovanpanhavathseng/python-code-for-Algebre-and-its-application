// This code will first define a function called union() that takes two sets as input and returns the union of those sets. The union of two sets is the collection of all elements that are in either set or both sets.

// The code then defines two sets, set_a and set_b, and then calls the union() function to find the union of those sets. The union of the two sets is then printed to the console.

// To run this code, you will need to have the Python standard library installed. You can install it with the following command:
