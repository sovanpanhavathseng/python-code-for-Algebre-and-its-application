// This code will first define a function called intersection() that takes two sets as input and returns the intersection of those sets. The intersection of two sets is the collection of all elements that are in both sets.

// The code then defines two sets, set_a and set_b, and then calls the intersection() function to find the intersection of those sets. The intersection of the two sets is then printed to the console.

// To run this code, you will need to have the Python standard library installed. You can install it with the following command:
