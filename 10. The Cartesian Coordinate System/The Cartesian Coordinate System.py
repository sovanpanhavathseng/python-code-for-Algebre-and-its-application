// This code first defines a function called CartesianCoordinateSystem(). This function takes two numbers, x and y, as input and prints them as a Cartesian coordinate. The function then defines a variable called x and assigns it the value 3. The function then defines a variable called y and assigns it the value 4. The function then calls the CartesianCoordinateSystem() function, passing in the values of x and y as arguments. The CartesianCoordinateSystem() function then prints the Cartesian coordinate, which is (3, 4).
