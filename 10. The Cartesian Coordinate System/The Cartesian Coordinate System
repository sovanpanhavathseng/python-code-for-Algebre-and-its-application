A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely by a pair of real numbers called coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, called coordinate axes, referred to as the x-axis and the y-axis.

The Cartesian coordinate system is named after Ren√© Descartes, who introduced it in the 17th century. It is the most common coordinate system used in mathematics, physics, and engineering.

In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the x-axis is usually horizontal and the y-axis is usually vertical. The origin is the point where the two axes intersect. The coordinates of a point are the signed distances from the origin to the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively.

For example, the point (3, 4) is 3 units to the right of the origin and 4 units above the origin. The point (-2, -3) is 2 units to the left of the origin and 3 units below the origin.

In a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, there are three axes: the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis. The x-axis is usually horizontal, the y-axis is usually vertical, and the z-axis is usually pointing out of the page. The origin is the point where the three axes intersect.

The coordinates of a point in three-dimensional space are the signed distances from the origin to the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis, respectively. For example, the point (3, 4, 5) is 3 units to the right of the origin, 4 units above the origin, and 5 units in front of the origin.

Cartesian coordinate systems are used to represent points, lines, curves, and surfaces in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space. They are also used to represent equations and inequalities.

Here are some of the benefits of using Cartesian coordinate systems:

* They are easy to understand and use.
* They can be used to represent points, lines, curves, and surfaces in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space.
* They can be used to represent equations and inequalities.

Here are some of the applications of Cartesian coordinate systems:

* Graphing points and lines
* Solving equations
* Optimizing functions
* 3D modeling
* Computer graphics
