An unbounded interval is a set of real numbers that extends to infinity in one or both directions. In other words, there is no largest or smallest number in the interval.

Unbounded intervals are often used to represent sets of numbers that have an infinite range. For example, the set of all real numbers is an unbounded interval.

There are two types of unbounded intervals:

* **Left unbounded intervals:** These intervals extend to infinity on the left side, but have a finite upper bound. For example, the interval (-∞, 2] is a left unbounded interval.
* **Right unbounded intervals:** These intervals extend to infinity on the right side, but have a finite lower bound. For example, the interval [2, ∞) is a right unbounded interval.

Unbounded intervals can also be half-bounded, which means that they are unbounded in one direction but not the other. For example, the interval (-∞, 0) is a half-bounded interval that is unbounded on the left side but not on the right side.

Here are some examples of unbounded intervals:

* (-∞, ∞)
* [2, ∞)
* (-∞, 0)
* (-∞, -1]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
