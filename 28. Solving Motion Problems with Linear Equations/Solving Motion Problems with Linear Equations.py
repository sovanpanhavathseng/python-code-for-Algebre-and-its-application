// This code first defines a function called solve_motion_problem(). This function takes three arguments: the distance traveled, the rate of speed, and the time. The function then uses the basic equation for motion to solve for the unknown variable. If the problem has no solution, the function returns None.

// The main function then calls the solve_motion_problem() function with the values for distance, rate, and time that were given in the problem. The main function then prints the result of the function call.

// To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as motion.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
