The vertical line test is a graphical method of determining whether a curve in the plane represents the graph of a function by visually examining the number of intersections of the curve with vertical lines.

A function can only have one output, y, for each unique input, x. If a vertical line intersects a curve on an xy-plane more than once then for one value of x the curve has more than one value of y, and so, the curve does not represent a function. If all vertical lines intersect a curve at most once then the curve represents a function.

Here are some examples of curves that pass the vertical line test:

* The graph of y = x^2 is a parabola that passes the vertical line test. If we draw a vertical line at any point on the graph, it will only intersect the graph at one point.

* The graph of y = |x| is a V-shaped curve that passes the vertical line test. If we draw a vertical line at any point on the graph, it will only intersect the graph at one point.

* The graph of y = x^3 is a curve that passes the vertical line test. If we draw a vertical line at any point on the graph, it will only intersect the graph at one point.

Here are some examples of curves that do not pass the vertical line test:

* The graph of y = x^2 + 1 is a parabola that does not pass the vertical line test. If we draw a vertical line at x = 0, it will intersect the graph at two points.

* The graph of y = |x| + 1 is a V-shaped curve that does not pass the vertical line test. If we draw a vertical line at x = 0, it will intersect the graph at two points.

* The graph of y = x^3 + 1 is a curve that does not pass the vertical line test. If we draw a vertical line at x = 0, it will intersect the graph at two points.

The vertical line test is a simple but effective way to determine whether a curve represents a function. If you can draw a vertical line that intersects the curve more than once, then the curve does not represent a function.
