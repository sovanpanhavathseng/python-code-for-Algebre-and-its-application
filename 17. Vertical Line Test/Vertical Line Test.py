// This code first defines a function called vertical_line_test. This function takes a list of points as input and returns True if the points represent the graph of a function, or False otherwise. The function works by looping through all the pairs of points in the list. For each pair of points, it checks if the two points have the same x-coordinate. If they do, then the function returns False, because this means that the vertical line that passes through the two points intersects the graph of the function at more than one point. Otherwise, the function returns True.

// The main function of the code then calls the vertical_line_test function with the list of points as input. If the function returns True, then the main function prints a message saying that the points represent the graph of a function. Otherwise, the main function prints a message saying that the points do not represent the graph of a function.

// To run the code, you can save it as a Python file and then run the file from the command line. For example, if you save the code as vertical_line_test.py, you can run the code by typing the following command into the command line:
